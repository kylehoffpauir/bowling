# bowling interview
The objective is to write a program (Python is best, but if you get stuck, whichever language you're most comfortable with is fine) that calculates a bowling score.  
Don't worry about the output looking pretty (up to you if you want to build a UI or just have it be a CLI application) or being able to handle more than one player.  

It should be able to:

    Accept user input for each throw
    Print out the current score after each frame
    Recognize when the game is complete

Some things to keep in mind:

    Looks don't matter.  Please don't spend much time on user experience or making it look good--print statements are fine.  This isn't a design exercise, so using `input()` is fine as well.
    Don't worry about edge cases, performance, or security.  We're more interested in seeing how you write/organize code than we are in it working perfectly.
    Please give this a good 2-3 hours of effort, but if you don't have that much time available or if it goes much longer than that, there's no pressure to finish--just send in what you have (preferably 24 hours before the interview), and we'll talk through the rest of it together when we meet.

The goal for this exercise is to get a sense of your coding style/experience and to have a starting point for discussions during your visit. 
 Again, it's fine if not everything works or if you do something a little hacky to finish quicker.  
 We can talk through those decisions in person, and you can tell us what you'd do differently if it were an important project or if you had more time.
