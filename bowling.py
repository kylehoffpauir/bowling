    # So what do we need to do?
    # take in user input until we are done with the game
    #   for each game, we do 10 frames
    #   each frame is 2 throws
    #   prompt user for score for throw 1
    #   prompt user for score for throw 2
    #   if the previous score was a strike, instead of simply adding to total score
    #       we need to add 1.5x the next score, maybe have a flag set
    #   on the 10th frame, if the user gets a strike/spare, continue throwing

    # so thats just the method for running the game
    # do we want to split this up into classes?
